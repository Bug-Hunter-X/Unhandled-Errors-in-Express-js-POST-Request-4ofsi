# Unhandled Errors in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows a vulnerable server.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The original code fails to handle potential errors when processing POST requests. If the request body is malformed or missing, the server might crash or produce unexpected results.  This can lead to security vulnerabilities and application instability.

## Solution

The solution involves adding comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage invalid or missing request data.  This includes checking the request body and handling potential exceptions.
